= Testing Libraries and Applications

This guide describes how to test libraries and applications using Enonic XP testing framework. It is based
on JUnit and requires a mix between Java and JavaScript. You need to bootstrap the tests using Java and
then you can write all your tests using pure JavaScript.

IMPORTANT: This describes how to test using the framework shipped with 6.12.0 (which is not yet released).
