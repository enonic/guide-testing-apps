== Testing a Controller

Testing controllers is identical to what is described in the previous section. For this example we have
a simple service that serves a GET request.

.src/main/resources/services/hello/hello.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::../src/main/resources/services/hello/hello.js[]
----

Let's write a test that tests two conditions: one where the parameter is not set and another one where
the parameter is set.

.src/test/resources/services/hello/hello-test.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::../src/test/resources/services/hello/hello-test.js[]
----

Again, to execute the test we a little bit of Java.

.src/test/java/com/enonic/guide/HelloServiceTest.java
[source, java]
----
include::../src/test/java/com/enonic/guide/HelloServiceTest.java[]
----
