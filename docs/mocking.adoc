== Mocking Services

Sometimes it can be useful to mock certain libraries so it's easier to test. Let's say we depend on a library
that gives us the time of day. To fix the return value in our tests we need to mock this library.

.src/main/resources/lib/time.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::../src/main/resources/lib/time.js[]
----

Our service that uses the time is like this:

.src/main/resources/services/clock/clock.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::../src/main/resources/services/clock/clock.js[]
----

To be able to test this we need to mock our time library in our test so we can return a fixed result.

.src/test/resources/services/clock/clock-test.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::../src/test/resources/services/clock/clock-test.js[]
----
<1> Mock the time library so we can control the output.
<2> Clock service uses the time library in code. It will get the mocked version.
