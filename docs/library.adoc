== Testing a Library

Let's start with a simple library which is just a plain JavaScript file with some exports. This library here
has a function returning a Fibonacci-sequence.

.src/main/resources/lib/fibonacci.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::../src/main/resources/lib/fibonacci.js[]
----

We can write a couple of tests for this. Let's test the function for a couple of inputs.

.src/test/resources/lib/fibonacci-test.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::../src/test/resources/lib/fibonacci-test.js[]
----

Every exported function that is prefixed with `test` is executed as a separate test. You can also export
`before` and `after` if you need to execute some logic before or after each test.

But, to be able to execute this test you will also need to write a little "bootstrap" code in Java. Here's
how this will look for this particular test:

.src/test/java/com/enonic/guide/FibonacciTest.java
[source, java]
